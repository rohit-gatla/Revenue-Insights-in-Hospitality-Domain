# Hospitality Domain Project: Atliq Grand Hotel - Revenue & Market Share Recovery

## Project Overview

Atliq Grand, a five-star hotel, faced a decline in its market share and revenue. 
To address this issue, I developed an end-to-end dashboard using **Power BI** to provide the Revenue team with actionable insights. 
This dashboard enabled the hotel to regain **20%** of its market share and revenue within a month.

## Problem Statement

Atliq Grand needed a data-driven solution to monitor its performance and identify areas for improvement. The goal was to facilitate data-informed decision-making that would lead to revenue recovery.

## Data Transformation and Modeling

- **Data Preparation:** Utilized **Power Query** to transform raw data into a structured format suitable for analysis.
- **Data Modeling:** Created a comprehensive data model to ensure accurate relationships between various data entities.

## Key Metrics and DAX Formulas

Developed DAX formulas to calculate essential key performance indicators (KPIs) such as:

- **RevPAR** (Revenue per Available Room)
- **DSRN** (Daily Sellable Room Nights)
- **ADR** (Average Daily Rate)
- **DBRN** (Daily Booked Room Nights)
- **DURN** (Daily Utilized Room Nights)
- **Occupancy %**
- **Realization %**
- **Cancellation %**
- **Total Revenue**

## Dashboard Features

- **Trend Analysis:** Visualizes ADR, occupancy %, and RevPAR over time to track performance.
- **Realization % and ADR Trends by Platforms:** Separate trend analyses for realization % and ADR based on various booking platforms.
- **Property Performance:** Visualized key metrics by property to assess individual performance.
- **KPI Insights:** Developed KPIs that provide valuable insights into overall hotel performance.
- **Week-over-Week Comparison:** Metrics to compare performance changes from the previous week, showing increases or decreases.
- **Tooltips:** Interactive tooltips that display weekly trends and day types based on the selected KPI.
- **Filters:** Incorporated various filters to allow users to customize their view and focus on specific data segments.
